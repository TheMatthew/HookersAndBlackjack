- Add GPL headers

- Stabilize bank

- Add crc on bank file. Human readable but we still need to work to hack it. 

- Add !Help option for Hooker and Blackjack

- Bet should be remembered for next deal
 
- Better hand state checks
 
- Short commands !b bet !d deal !h hit !s stand !d doubledown !p split (not sure)
 
- show cards in short form not words (e.g. [5s Kd 10h Ac] (not sure)
 
- show card total after first two cards and every card. show soft total e.g. 4/14
(hint: if you count all aces as 1 and the total is <= 11, then show both soft/hard totals) (not sure)
 
- you could show the options to the player after each card (ie. !h !s [!d] [!p] if applicable)
 
- dealer stands on soft 17
 
- automatic stand on player 21 (soft or hard)
 
- show money balance on every hand outcome
 
- double down is only on first 2 cards, it makes a hit and no possibility of getting a 4th card
 
- split if first 2 cards are equal (technically can split on mix of 10/J/Q/K but not recommended...)
you then play two hands one after the other, each get a new 2nd card and you can double down again
 
- if not too hard to code it, you can split again if you get the same card again
